## How to contribute to the Permissions Database

Our Plugin Ultra Permissions simplifies the need to search for permissions by suggesting them based on installed plugins. The permission suggestions will be retrieved from [this file](https://github.com/TechsCode/PluginResources/blob/master/Permissions%20Database/Database.updb).

To contribute, pick a plugin that has not been added yet and add all the permissions line by line to that file.
Please make a new comment for each plugin, it makes it easier to review.
Please also include a link to the plugin page/the page that shows the permissions.
